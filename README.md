# About The Project

The BURG.L Discord Bot is a resource manager that aids [Grounded](https://grounded.obsidian.net/) players by tracking requirements and allocating tasks. BURG.L pulls data from the [Grounded Wiki](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Grounded_Wiki) to get information for items, such as crafting costs.

Despite the recent introduction of slash commands by Discord, prefix commands are still used in this project as Discord's in-game overlay does not work with slash commands.

The overall roadmap and development tracker for this project can be found on the Trello board below:
